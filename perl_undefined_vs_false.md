In Perl, undef and false are related but not the same thing. This distinction is especially important when reading CSV data.

🔹 1️⃣ undef (Undefined Value)

An undefined value means the variable has no value at all.

my $x;
print "undef\n" unless defined $x;

✔ defined($x) → false
✔ $x in boolean context → false
✔ $x eq "" → warning (uninitialized value)

Typical causes:

Variable declared but not assigned

Missing CSV column

Explicit undef

🔹 2️⃣ False Value (Defined but False)

A false value is defined, but evaluates to false in boolean context.

Common false values in Perl:

""      # empty string
0       # numeric zero
"0"     # string zero

Example:

my $x = "";
print "defined\n" if defined $x;      # true
print "false\n" unless $x;            # true

✔ defined($x) → true
✔ $x in boolean context → false
✔ $x eq "" → true

🔹 In a CSV Context

Consider this CSV row:

John,,25

If parsed correctly:

Column 1 → "John"

Column 2 → "" (empty string, defined but false)

Column 3 → "25"

But if a column is missing entirely (short row):

John,25

Then the third column might be:

undef (depending on parser behavior)

🔹 How to Properly Check
✅ Check if value exists at all:
if (defined $value) {
✅ Check if value is non-empty:
if (defined $value && $value ne "") {
🚫 Avoid this if you need to distinguish:
if ($value) {   # WRONG if 0 is valid

Because this treats:

undef

""

"0"

0

as the same.

🔹 Summary Table
Value	defined()?	Boolean True?
undef	❌ No	❌ No
""	✅ Yes	❌ No
"0"	✅ Yes	❌ No
0	✅ Yes	❌ No
"abc"	✅ Yes	✅ Yes
🔹 Best Practice for CSV

If empty fields are meaningful, always check:

if (!defined $value) {
    # column missing
}
elsif ($value eq "") {
    # column present but empty
}

If you tell me which CSV module you're using (e.g., Text::CSV, Text::CSV_XS), I can show module-specific behavior.

Neither - no module, just reading in and using split on the comma delimiter

If you're using plain split /,/ to read CSV data, the difference between undef and false (empty string) becomes very clear — because split never returns undef for a field that exists.

🔹 What split Actually Returns

Example:

my $line = "John,,25";
my @fields = split /,/, $line;

Result:

@fields = ("John", "", "25");

The middle field is:

"" (empty string)

defined

false in boolean context

🔹 When Do You Get undef?

You get undef only if you access an index that doesn’t exist:

my $line = "John,25";
my @fields = split /,/, $line;

print defined $fields[2] ? "defined\n" : "undef\n";

Output:

undef

Because index 2 was never created.

🔹 Important Gotcha: Trailing Empty Fields

By default, split removes trailing empty fields.

my $line = "John,25,";
my @fields = split /,/, $line;

Result:

("John", "25")   # last empty field is LOST

To preserve trailing empty fields:

my @fields = split /,/, $line, -1;

Now you get:

("John", "25", "")

This is critical if empty columns matter.

🔹 How to Distinguish Properly
Check if column exists
if (exists $fields[2]) {
    print "Column exists\n";
}
Check if defined
if (defined $fields[2]) {
    print "Defined\n";
}
Check if empty
if (defined $fields[2] && $fields[2] eq "") {
    print "Empty but present\n";
}
🔹 Summary (Using split)
Situation	Result in Array
John,,25	"" (defined, empty)
Missing column	undef
Trailing comma (without -1)	field removed
Trailing comma (with -1)	""
🔹 Recommended Safe Pattern

If column count matters:

my @fields = split /,/, $line, -1;

if (!exists $fields[2]) {
    print "Column missing\n";
}
elsif ($fields[2] eq "") {
    print "Column empty\n";
}
