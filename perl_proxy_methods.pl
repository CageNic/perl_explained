Configuring LWP::UserAgent to Use a Proxy
LWP::UserAgent is the core component in Perl for making web requests. Here's how to point it at a proxy:

1. Use Environment Variables
Set the HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY env vars to your proxy URL:

Copy
$ENV{HTTP_PROXY} = '<http://192.168.1.42:8080>';
$ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
$ua->env_proxy;
This automatically picks up the proxy from the environment.

2. The proxy() Method
You can directly pass the proxy to use through proxy():

Copy
my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;
$ua->proxy('http', '<http://proxy.example.com:8080>');
Also set protocols_allowed to enforce using the proxy:

Copy
$ua->protocols_allowed(['http']);
